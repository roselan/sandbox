## Dry Bulk Webapp

Open `index.html` in a browser to view sample cargos. Right-click a cargo and choose **Suitable Ships** to open the Ship ETA page. The Ship ETA page pre-filters ships by the cargo's load port and sets the laycan filter to five days before the cargo's laycan. Ships arriving before the laycan are shown in red.
